Under my public_html directory I have a cgi-bin directory which contains a simple.cgi perl script that takes my form and get action and parses and returns the strings.

My index.html file is just a simple form with textboxes and checkboxes. It uses a simple style.css sheet.

I'm unsure if I used CGI properly for my forms, but once you submit a form you get back the cgi content-type as well as the form values.
